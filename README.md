# VOT2EX
This is an Arduino Project, trying to get and convert the Open Telemetry Packet from the EagleTree Vector Flightcontroller, sent over UART. It performs a conversion and sends it as Jeti EX protocol to a Jeti receiver. You get live telemetry data on your Jeti Transmitter (EX and JetiBox). This is work in progressâ€¦
